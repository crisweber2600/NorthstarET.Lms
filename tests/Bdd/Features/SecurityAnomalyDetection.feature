Feature: Security Anomaly Detection
    As a SecurityAdministrator
    I want the system to detect and respond to security anomalies
    So that unauthorized access attempts and suspicious activities are prevented and logged

Background:
    Given I am authenticated as a PlatformAdmin
    And the security monitoring system is active
    And the following alert thresholds are configured:
        | Alert Type              | Threshold | Window  | Response        |
        | Failed Login Attempts   | 5         | 5 min   | Account Lock    |
        | Cross-Tenant Access     | 1         | 1 min   | Immediate Block |
        | Unusual Data Volume     | 1000 recs | 10 min  | Rate Limit      |
        | Off-Hours Admin Actions | 3         | 1 hour  | Alert Only      |

Scenario: Detect and block brute force login attempts
    Given a user account "john.teacher@oaklandschools.org" exists
    When there are 5 failed login attempts for the account within 3 minutes
    Then the account should be temporarily locked
    And a Tier 2 security alert should be generated
    And the IP address should be flagged for monitoring
    And a SecurityAnomalyDetectedEvent should be raised
    And all failed attempts should be audited

Scenario: Detect cross-tenant data access attempt
    Given a user has permissions for district "oakland-unified"
    When the user attempts to access data from district "san-jose-unified"
    Then the access should be immediately blocked
    And a Tier 3 security alert should be generated
    And the user's session should be terminated
    And the incident should trigger immediate notification to security team
    And a CrossTenantViolationEvent should be raised

Scenario: Detect unusual data export volume
    Given a user typically exports 10-50 student records per session
    When the user attempts to export 1500 student records in a single request
    Then the export should be rate-limited
    And the request should require additional approval
    And a Tier 1 security alert should be generated
    And the user should be notified of the additional review requirement

Scenario: Monitor off-hours administrative actions
    Given the current time is 2:00 AM on a Sunday
    When a DistrictAdmin performs 3 user management actions
    Then a Tier 1 security alert should be generated
    And the actions should be flagged for review
    And the admin should receive a notification about the monitoring
    And the actions should be allowed to proceed but closely logged

Scenario: Escalate repeated security violations
    Given a user has triggered 2 Tier 1 alerts in the past 24 hours
    When the user triggers another security alert
    Then the alert should be escalated to Tier 2
    And the user's account should be flagged for manual review
    And the security team should be notified immediately
    And a SecurityEscalationEvent should be raised

Scenario: Automated response to high-severity threats
    Given a Tier 3 security alert is triggered
    When the automated response system activates
    Then the associated user account should be immediately suspended
    And all active sessions for the user should be terminated
    And the security team should receive immediate notification
    And the incident should be logged for forensic analysis

Scenario: False positive handling and alert tuning
    Given a security alert is marked as a false positive by security team
    When I review the alert pattern
    Then the detection rule should be automatically tuned
    And similar patterns should be less likely to trigger alerts
    And the tuning action should be audited
    And a SecurityRuleTunedEvent should be raised

Scenario: Generate security dashboard metrics
    When I request security metrics for the past 30 days
    Then the dashboard should show:
        | Metric                    | Description                              |
        | Total Alerts Generated    | Count by tier and type                   |
        | False Positive Rate       | Percentage of alerts marked as false    |
        | Response Time             | Average time to alert resolution         |
        | Blocked Attempts          | Count of successfully blocked threats    |
        | Account Suspensions       | Automated and manual suspensions         |

Scenario: Anomaly detection during bulk operations
    Given a bulk student import operation is in progress
    When the import attempts to create duplicate identity mappings
    Then the anomaly detection should flag the operation
    And the bulk job should be paused for review
    And a BulkOperationAnomalyEvent should be raised
    And the system should await manual intervention

Scenario: Geographic anomaly detection
    Given a user typically accesses the system from California
    When the same user logs in from an international IP address
    Then additional authentication should be required
    And a geographic anomaly alert should be generated
    And the login attempt should be logged with geolocation data
    And the user should be prompted to verify the login attempt
