# Tests Directory

## Purpose
Contains all test code for the NorthstarET.Lms system organized by test type and architectural layer, following BDD-First Testing and TDD principles.

## Architecture Context
Implements Constitution Principles I and II:
- **BDD-First Testing**: Feature files with Reqnroll scenarios written before implementation
- **TDD Red-Green Cycle**: Unit and integration tests written before production code

## Directory Structure

### BDD Feature Tests
- `Features/` - Reqnroll feature files organized by business domain
- `StepDefinitions/` - Step definition implementations for BDD scenarios

### Unit & Integration Tests
- `NorthstarET.Lms.Domain.Tests/` - Domain entity and value object tests
- `NorthstarET.Lms.Application.Tests/` - Application service and use case tests  
- `NorthstarET.Lms.Infrastructure.Tests/` - Repository and external service tests
- `NorthstarET.Lms.Api.Tests/` - Controller and API integration tests

## Usage Examples

### Run All Tests
```bash
dotnet test tests/
```

### Run BDD Feature Tests Only
```bash
dotnet test tests/ --filter Category=BDD
```

### Run Unit Tests for Specific Layer
```bash
dotnet test tests/NorthstarET.Lms.Domain.Tests/
```

### Generate Test Coverage Report
```bash
dotnet test tests/ --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --results-directory TestResults/
```

## Test Strategy

### BDD Testing (Principle I)
- All business requirements expressed as Gherkin scenarios
- Feature files written before any implementation code
- Step definitions implement test automation
- Covers complete user journeys and acceptance criteria

### TDD Implementation (Principle II)
- Unit tests written before production code (RED phase)
- Implementation makes tests pass (GREEN phase)  
- Refactor with test coverage maintained
- Target >90% coverage for Domain and Application layers

## Current Test Status
- âœ… **18 Feature Files**: Complete BDD scenarios for all domains
- âœ… **31 Application Service Tests**: All services have comprehensive test coverage
- âœ… **Domain Entity Tests**: Core business logic validated
- ðŸ”„ **Integration Tests**: In progress for infrastructure and API layers
