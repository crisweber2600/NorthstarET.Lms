# Feature Specifications Directory

## Purpose
Contains complete feature specifications, contracts, and documentation for the NorthstarET.Lms system following Feature Specification Completeness principle.

## Architecture Context
Implements Constitution Principle V - every feature must start with complete specification including user scenarios, acceptance criteria, and edge cases before any implementation begins.

## Directory Structure

### Active Features
- `001-foundational-lms-with/` - Core LMS functionality specification

### Specification Components
Each feature directory contains:
- `plan.md` - Technical architecture and implementation plan
- `data-model.md` - Entity relationships and domain model
- `tasks.md` - Detailed implementation task breakdown
- `contracts/` - API specifications and integration contracts
- `research.md` - Technical decisions and architectural choices
- `quickstart.md` - Integration scenarios and usage examples

## Usage Examples

### Review Feature Specification
```bash
# Read complete feature specification
cat specs/001-foundational-lms-with/plan.md

# Review domain model
cat specs/001-foundational-lms-with/data-model.md
```

### Validate Implementation Progress
```bash
# Check task completion status
cat specs/001-foundational-lms-with/tasks.md | grep -E "\[X\]|\[ \]"
```

### Generate API Documentation
```bash
# Review API contracts
ls -la specs/001-foundational-lms-with/contracts/
```

## Specification Standards

### Completeness Requirements (Constitution Principle V)
- User scenarios with acceptance criteria
- Technical architecture decisions
- Data model with entity relationships  
- API contracts with request/response schemas
- Edge cases and error handling scenarios
- Performance and security requirements

### Traceability Requirements
- Features map to BDD scenarios in `tests/Features/`
- Tasks map to implementation in `src/`
- Contracts map to API endpoints and controllers
- Requirements must be testable and unambiguous

## Current Specification Status
- ✅ **Feature 001**: Complete specification for foundational LMS functionality
- ✅ **Domain Model**: Multi-tenant architecture with clean boundaries
- ✅ **API Contracts**: Complete REST API specification for all domains
- ✅ **Implementation Plan**: Phase-based development with TDD approach
- ✅ **Task Breakdown**: 70+ detailed implementation tasks with dependencies

## Recent Changes
- 2025-01-09: Updated task completion status for Application layer (T058-T070)
- 2024-12-19: Complete specification for foundational LMS feature
- 2024-12-19: Added comprehensive API contracts for all business domains
