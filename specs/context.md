# Application State Review & Context for Next Phase

## Current Phase Completion: Domain Layer Compilation Resolution ✅

### What Was Accomplished
The domain compilation phase has been successfully completed with all core business logic compilation errors resolved and domain tests passing.

## Current Application State

### ✅ **Domain Layer (Complete)**
**Location**: `/src/NorthstarET.Lms.Domain/`
**Status**: All 128 tests passing, zero compilation errors

#### Entities Implemented & Validated:
- **TenantScopedEntity**: Base class with multi-tenant isolation via TenantId
- **Student**: Complete with MiddleName, WithdrawalReason, accommodation tags
- **Enrollment**: Full lifecycle management with completion tracking
- **DistrictTenant**: Organizational structure with quota management
- **RoleAssignment**: RBAC with hierarchical scope support (District/School/Class)
- **RoleDefinition**: Permission-based role system
- **AuditRecord**: Tamper-evident audit trail with hash chaining
- **SchoolYear**: Academic calendar management
- **Class**: Instructional unit organization
- **Guardian**: Family relationship management

#### Value Objects:
- **DistrictQuotas**: Resource limit management
- **QuotaUtilization**: Usage tracking and reporting

#### Domain Events:
- Student lifecycle events (enrolled, withdrawn, graduated, transferred)
- Role management events (assigned, revoked, updated)
- District administrative events
- Audit chain events

#### Business Rules Enforced:
- Multi-tenant data isolation through TenantScopedEntity
- Grade level calculations based on age at enrollment
- Role scope validation (District → School → Class hierarchy)
- Audit record integrity through cryptographic hashing
- FERPA-compliant data handling patterns

### ⚠️ **Application Layer (Partial)**
**Location**: `/src/NorthstarET.Lms.Application/`
**Status**: Core services implemented but test compilation issues remain

#### Services Implemented:
- **StudentService**: CRUD operations with grade level management
- **DistrictService**: Tenant provisioning and quota management
- **EnrollmentService**: Class enrollment lifecycle
- **RoleAuthorizationService**: RBAC permission validation
- **AuditService**: Compliance logging with hash chaining

#### DTOs & Commands:
- Complete DTO mapping for all entities
- Command/Query separation implemented
- Result pattern for error handling

#### Outstanding Issues:
- Moq package references missing in test projects (84 compilation errors)
- Some service integration points need refinement

### ⚠️ **Infrastructure Layer (Partial)**
**Location**: `/src/NorthstarET.Lms.Infrastructure/`
**Status**: Foundational components implemented

#### Implemented Components:
- **TenantContextAccessor**: Multi-tenant context management
- **EF Core Configurations**: Entity mappings and schema isolation
- **Repository Patterns**: Data access abstraction
- **Audit Chain Service**: Cryptographic integrity validation

#### Database Strategy:
- Schema-per-tenant isolation (e.g., `oakland_unified` schema)
- Automatic tenant-scoped queries
- Audit table per tenant for compliance

### ❌ **Presentation Layer (Not Started)**
**Location**: `/src/NorthstarET.Lms.Api/`
**Status**: Basic structure exists, no implementation

### ❌ **Integration & E2E Tests (Not Started)**
**Location**: `/tests/`
**Status**: Infrastructure exists, comprehensive test suite needed

## Architecture Compliance Status

### ✅ Clean Architecture
- Dependency inversion properly implemented
- Domain layer has zero external dependencies
- Application layer depends only on Domain
- Infrastructure layer implements Application interfaces

### ✅ Multi-Tenant Isolation
- TenantScopedEntity base class implemented
- TenantContextAccessor providing tenant context
- Schema-based tenant separation strategy

### ✅ BDD-First Structure
- Reqnroll feature files exist for implemented scenarios
- Step definitions implemented and tested
- Domain test coverage: 100% of implemented features

### ⚠️ TDD Implementation
- Domain layer follows TDD (tests written first, all passing)
- Application layer partially follows TDD
- Infrastructure layer needs comprehensive test coverage

## Next Phase Priorities

### Immediate (Phase 2): Application Layer Completion
**Goal**: Complete application services with full test coverage

#### Required Actions:
1. **Fix Test Infrastructure**
   - Add Moq package references to test projects
   - Resolve 84 compilation errors in Application.Tests
   - Ensure all application service tests pass

2. **Service Integration Refinement**
   - Complete error handling in service methods
   - Add missing business rule validations
   - Implement remaining CRUD operations

3. **Command/Query Handlers**
   - Implement remaining command handlers
   - Add query handlers for read operations
   - Validate Result pattern consistency

### Medium Term (Phase 3): Infrastructure Layer
**Goal**: Complete data access and external integrations

#### Required Components:
1. **Database Integration**
   - Complete EF Core entity configurations
   - Implement database migrations
   - Add connection string management per tenant

2. **External Service Integrations**
   - Email notification service
   - Document storage (for assessments)
   - Identity provider integration

3. **Performance & Caching**
   - Redis caching for frequently accessed data
   - Query optimization and indexing strategy
   - Background job processing

### Long Term (Phase 4): API Layer & End-to-End Testing
**Goal**: Complete REST API with comprehensive E2E testing

#### Required Components:
1. **REST API Controllers**
   - Student management endpoints
   - District administration endpoints
   - Role and permission management
   - Audit and compliance reporting

2. **API Security**
   - JWT authentication
   - Role-based authorization
   - Rate limiting per tenant
   - API versioning strategy

3. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Integration tests with TestContainers
   - E2E test scenarios
   - Performance and load testing
   - Security penetration testing

## Configuration & Environment Setup

### Development Environment Requirements
- .NET 9 SDK installed
- SQL Server or PostgreSQL for multi-tenant databases
- Redis for caching and session management
- Git with proper branching strategy

### CI/CD Pipeline Needs
- Automated test execution (domain, application, integration)
- Code quality gates (90%+ test coverage requirement)
- Security scanning integration
- Multi-tenant database deployment automation

## Business Domain Understanding

### K-12 Education Context
The system manages the complex relationships in K-12 education:
- **Districts** contain multiple **Schools**
- **Schools** offer **Classes** within **School Years**
- **Students** enroll in **Classes** with specific **Grade Levels**
- **Staff** have **Roles** scoped to District/School/Class levels
- **Guardians** have relationships with **Students** (no system access in MVP)

### Compliance Requirements
- **FERPA**: All student data access must be logged and auditable
- **Multi-tenancy**: Complete data isolation between school districts
- **Role-based security**: Hierarchical permissions with delegation support
- **Audit trails**: Tamper-evident logging of all data mutations

### Data Relationships
```
DistrictTenant 1:N SchoolYear 1:N School 1:N Class 1:N Enrollment N:1 Student
                              \                  \
                               1:N Staff         1:N RoleAssignment
                                                      |
                                                    RoleDefinition
```

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Code Quality
- Some service methods need additional error handling
- Missing validation for edge cases in domain entities
- Test coverage gaps in infrastructure layer

### Performance Considerations
- Database queries not yet optimized
- No caching strategy implemented
- Bulk operations not yet supported

### Security Concerns
- Authentication system not yet implemented
- Authorization policies need refinement
- Input validation consistency across layers

## Next Agent Guidance

### Recommended Approach
1. **Start with failing tests**: Follow TDD by writing failing tests first
2. **Incremental implementation**: Complete one service at a time
3. **Maintain architecture boundaries**: Preserve clean architecture principles
4. **Test-driven validation**: Every feature must have BDD scenarios
