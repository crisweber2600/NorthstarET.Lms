## Feature Overview

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
- **Schema-per-tenant**: Each district gets isolated database schema
- **Dynamic connection strings**: Runtime tenant resolution
- **Tenant-scoped entities**: All data automatically isolated by tenant
- **Cross-tenant operations**: Platform-level audit and administration

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Hierarchical roles**: Platform → District → School → Class scopes
- **Predicate-based permissions**: Fine-grained authorization rules
- **Context-aware authorization**: Permissions validated against user scope
- **Delegation support**: Role assignment with expiration and delegation chains

### FERPA Compliance
- **Tamper-evident audit trails**: SHA-256 hash chaining for integrity
- **Retention policies**: Automated data lifecycle with legal hold support
- **Access logging**: Comprehensive audit of all data access operations
- **Data minimization**: Purpose-limited data collection and retention

### Academic Workflows
- **Student lifecycle**: Registration → Enrollment → Progression → Graduation/Withdrawal
- **Grade progression**: Automated K-12 grade level advancement with validation
- **Class management**: Enrollment capacity, scheduling, and roster management
- **Bulk operations**: Year-end rollover with grade level mapping

## Implementation Status

### Completed Phases
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Complete feature specification and API contracts
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Domain layer with entities, events, and value objects  
- ✅ **Phase 3.1-3.4**: BDD feature files and TDD test foundation
- ✅ **Phase 3.5**: Application layer services and DTOs (TDD GREEN phase)

### Current Phase
- 🔄 **Phase 3.6**: Infrastructure layer with EF Core and repository implementations

### Upcoming Phases
- ⏳ **Phase 3.7**: API layer with controllers and authentication
- ⏳ **Phase 3.8**: Aspire orchestration and service discovery
- ⏳ **Phase 4**: Integration testing and deployment
