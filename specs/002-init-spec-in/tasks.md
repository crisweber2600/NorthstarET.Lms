# Tasks: Init Spec In

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-init-spec-in/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required)

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project structure

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [x] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan - create src/ and tests/ directories
- [x] T002 Initialize basic project structure with necessary directories
- [x] T003 [P] Configure basic file structure for spec input functionality

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
- [x] T004 [P] Create unit test structure in tests/unit/test_spec_input.py
- [x] T005 [P] Create integration test structure in tests/integration/test_spec_integration.py
- [x] T006 [P] Create basic test cases for spec input validation

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [x] T007 Create basic spec input model in src/models/spec_input.py
- [x] T008 Create spec input service in src/services/spec_input_service.py
- [x] T009 Implement core spec input functionality

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [x] T010 Integrate spec input with main application
- [x] T011 [P] Add error handling and validation
- [x] T012 [P] Add logging and monitoring

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [x] T013 [P] Run and validate all unit tests
- [x] T014 [P] Performance validation and optimization
- [x] T015 [P] Update documentation

## Dependencies
- Tests (T004-T006) before implementation (T007-T009)
- T007 blocks T008, T009
- Implementation before polish (T013-T015)

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Validation Checklist
- [x] All tests come before implementation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
