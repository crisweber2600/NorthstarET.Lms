# Architecture Decision Record (ADR-002): Clean Architecture Implementation

## Status
**Accepted** - December 19, 2024

## Context
The NorthstarET Learning Management System requires a maintainable, testable, and scalable architecture that can evolve with changing educational requirements while maintaining strict separation of concerns and dependency management.

## Decision
We will implement **Clean Architecture** with a strict four-layer approach:

1. **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic with zero external dependencies
2. **Application Layer**: Use cases and orchestration, depends only on Domain
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns (DB, APIs), depends on Application
4. **Presentation Layer**: Controllers and UI, depends on Infrastructure

### Project Structure
```
src/
├── NorthstarET.Lms.Domain/              # Core business logic
├── NorthstarET.Lms.Application/         # Use cases and orchestration
├── NorthstarET.Lms.Infrastructure/      # External concerns
└── NorthstarET.Lms.Api/                # HTTP API interface
```

### Dependency Flow Rules
```
Presentation → Infrastructure → Application → Domain
```

**Forbidden Dependencies**:
- Domain cannot reference any other layer
- Application cannot reference Infrastructure or Presentation
- Infrastructure cannot reference Presentation

## Benefits Realized

### 1. Testability
- Domain Layer: Pure unit tests with no external dependencies
- Application Layer: Service tests with mocked repositories
- Infrastructure Layer: Integration tests with real databases

### 2. Framework Independence
- Business logic isolated from Entity Framework, ASP.NET Core
- Domain layer can be reused across different presentation layers

### 3. Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Changes in external systems don't affect business logic
- Consistent patterns across features

## Quality Gates

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Domain Layer: >95% coverage (critical business logic)
- Application Layer: >90% coverage (use case orchestration)
- Infrastructure Layer: >75% coverage (integration focused)
- Presentation Layer: >80% coverage (API contract validation)

## Consequences

### Positive
- High testability and maintainability
- Framework independence and flexibility
- Clear code organization and team boundaries

### Negative  
- Initial complexity with more files and interfaces
- Learning curve for clean architecture principles
- Additional abstraction overhead
